## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I have a strong interest in **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI**, and **cloud-based deployment of machine learning systems**, with hands-on experience across the **entire ML lifecycle** from data exploration and model training to deployment and inference serving.

I have worked extensively on **training and deploying deep learning models**, managing large model artifacts, and exposing inference services through **production-ready APIs** using **FastAPI**, **Docker**, and **Hugging Face Hub / Spaces**. My work emphasizes **reproducibility**, **scalability**, and **clean system design**, particularly for research-driven and real-world ML applications.

In addition, my background in **full-stack web development** enables me to design **intuitive user interfaces** and **robust backend services** that effectively integrate machine learning models into end-to-end, user-facing systems.
